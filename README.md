## Stephan Gloeckner

Hi 👋, I’m Stephan!

What do I do? I solve problems using data! I specialize in improving process quality in manufacturing and tackling challenges across various fields, including social media, video games, and e-commerce.

Currently, I work as a _data scientist_ in manufacturing and quality assurance. My role involves:

    Developing business intelligence solutions (e.g., KPI dashboards) for internal and external stakeholders
    Building machine learning applications for monitoring and quality assurance using web-based platforms.

I earned my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Melbourne, where I gained extensive experience in data analysis and data profiling as part of the Melbourne eResearch Group.

Teaching and sharing knowledge is another passion of mine. I teach machine learning and love simplifying complex data through clear, impactful visualizations. Teaching not only helps me share knowledge but also deepens my understanding. As Einstein said: _“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”_

To stay sharp, I regularly explore diverse datasets, read blogs or reddit and refine my expertise. Whether it’s improving processes, solving data challenges, or visualizing insights, I am always excited to tackle the next problem.
