## Stephan Gloeckner

Hi 👋, I am Stephan.

What I do? I solve problems using **data**! Currently, I work as a _data scientist_ in epidemiology, developing business intelligence solutions (e.g. KPI dashboards) for internal and external stakeholders, as well as developing data-related products (web-based plattforms). I received my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Melbourne and could get a lot experience about data related products during this time within the Melbourne eResearch Group.

Teaching and holding talks is my second passion. I am teaching machine learning and I do love to visualise complex data with simple graphs. Teaching helps me understanding complex circumstances. "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." _(Einstein)_ Therefore, I am regularly exploring different kinds of data to improve and adapt my expertise. 

## Skills
- 🖥️ I'm programming in ___R___ and ___python___, for everything else I use a lot of other languages, like ___SQL___ or simply ___bash___
- 📰 For reporting my results I use the ___JAM-Stack___ (netlify), ___shiny___ applications, ___markdown___, ___docker___ and a bit ___AWS___
- ⏱️ I spend the most time of my day with importing data from several APIs, raw data files and transforming all of this into nice and clean (yes _'tidy'_) data
- 🙊 I'm fluent in English and German, I can read Russian and explore Finnish
- 💬 I'm absolutly passionate about exploratory data mining, data quality, user experience research, data viz, badminton, climbing, aquaponics
